Late Night Show API
Welcome to the Late Night Show API! This Flask-based project manages episodes of a late-night TV show, its guests, and the appearances they make. It models the relationships between episodes, guests, and their ratings using SQLAlchemy and exposes RESTful endpoints for interaction.

By Stephen Mwangi Maina
Project Overview
This API simulates a late-night talk show, where each episode can have multiple guests, and each guest can appear in multiple episodes. Guests are rated based on their appearances.

Entities:
Episode – A talk show episode with a date and episode number.
Guest – A celebrity who appears on the show, with a name and occupation.
Appearance – A join table representing a guest’s appearance on an episode, with a rating from 1–5.
Features
Full CRUD for Episodes and Guests
Custom POST for creating Appearances with validations
Seed script to populate data from a CSV
Clean RESTful architecture
Database migrations using Flask-Migrate
